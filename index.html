    <h1>How to play Magic The Gathering</h1>
   <main>
      <p>Magic the gathering is a huge cardgame made by Wizards of the coast in which players battle eachother</p>
      <p>The core mechanic feature 5 different colors each with their own stratedgy a player can use as many or as little colors as they want</p>
      <p>The game is somewhat complicated but after a few games a player can come to understand most of the rules</p>
  </main>
    <p> Magic the gathering is a very old card game with many rules. As such it
    can be difficult for new people to learn.</p>
    <h1>Some Basic rules</h2>
    <p>A standard game will have players start at 20 life and cut their deck 
    show the card they pull and the player with the highest cost card gets to 
	decide the turn order the person who goes first does not draw on the first turn</p>
    <p>Cards cost lands/mana you can play one land each turn normally some 
	cards can get around this like searching the deck for a basic land card and
	putting into play tapped </p>
    <p>Tapping a card means its action has been used, a land would be tapped in
	order to pay a cards mana cost or a creature would have to tap to attack<p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to make your opponent lose his or her total
	life and reduce it to zero. Some cards may allow someone to win the game wi
	thout reducing your opponents life but these are rare and usually hard to activate</p>
	<p>Players have a max hand size of seven cards; if they exeed this size 
	they have to discard a card.<p>
	<p>Cards hava a mana cost lands are the main way of generating mana</p>
	<p>There are 6 different colors in magic red, blue, green, white, and 
	black, each color has a different stratedgy</p>
	 <p>Creatures can only attack once per turn.</p>
	
	<h3>Deck building</h2>
	<p>A standard deck size is 60 cards. you cant have more than four of the 
	same card, Basic lands are excluded from this rule.</p>
	<p>Some cards will have a legendary rule. Only one of that legendary cards 
	can exist on the battlefield/board</p>
	
	
	
    <h3>Card types</h4>
    <p>Lands are the most important card type as the game is impossible with 
    out lands or some way of generating mana.</p>
	
    <p>Lands generate mana depending on their color some can let the player 
    choose the kind of mana it creates.</p>

    <p> Creatures cards have a creature type and are capable of attacking and blocking.</p>
    <p>A creature has to tap to attack unless it has vigilance it does not need to tap.
    This creature is better suited for blocking due to its high toughness and low power.</p>

    <p> Artifacts have many different abilities and can adapt to fit the deck 
    or players can choose to focus artifacts instead of a color. </p>

    <p>Equipment are a more specific artifact. A player has to pay to play it 
    and then pay the equipment cost to attach it to a creature and while the 
    creature may die the equipment stays</p>
