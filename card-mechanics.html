   <p>Wizards of the Coast has been making cards for the game for over 20 years. Because of this they have a lot of 
    different card mechanics and lots of rulesas such this will only go over some of the more common ones</p>
  </main>
    <h1>Different card mechanics</h1>
    <p>Trample: is an ability that lets an attacking creatures damage go 
    through the creature it is blocking if its power exeeds that creatures toughness/health</p>
    <p>Vigilance: lets a creature attack without tapping this does not mean the 
    creature can attack twice but if it has another ability that could be used 
    or it could be saved for blocking </p>
    <p>Defender: Is simple in that a creature with defender cannot , many 
    wall type cards use Defender</p>
    <p>Haste: Lets a creature attack the turn it is played</p>
    <p>Flash: Enables a card to be played during the opponents turn like an 
    instant card</p>
	
	<h2>Phases</h2>
	<p>A turn in magic has multiple phases in which actions can be done</p>
    
    <list>
	  <ol>
		<li>Begining phase</li>
		<li>Pre combat main phase</li>
		<li>combat phase</li>
		<li>Post combat main phase</li>
		<li>Ending phase</li>
	  </ol>
	     </list>
	<p>The begining phase is made up of three parts the untap stap where you
    untap tapped permanents such as land creatures artifacts. Then comes the 
    upkeep step, some cards require you to pay an upkeep and if you dont the 
    card will usually have to be sacraficed meaning it has to go into your 
    graveyard. Lastly is the draw step where a player draws their card</p>
    <p>The pre combat main phase is the phase where most actions can be done
    sorcerys can only be cast in the pre or post main, phase some cards 
    abilities will function like this as well. This is where you would play a 
    land or a creature</p>
    <p>The combat phase is where a player declares what creatures are attacking
    and which player they are attacking the player being attacked can then 
    declare blockers or what their creatures are going to block.
    Instants can also be cast during this phase even if it isnt your turn</p>
    <p>After combat is finished and damage has been dealt comes the post main
    phase which functions identically to the pre main phase other than the fact
    that combat has taken plase</p>
    <p>The Ending phase has two steps the end step and cleanup step. The end 
    step is where certatin cards abilities activate while the cleanup ste
    p is where one would discard their cards if they exeeded the maximum hand 
    size.<p>
